This error occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library and attempting to access the `uri` property of the selected image before the image has fully loaded.  This often happens when you try to immediately use the `uri` within the `response.uri` callback of the `launchImageLibraryAsync` or `launchCameraAsync` functions. The `uri` might be undefined or null at that point, leading to unexpected behavior or app crashes.
